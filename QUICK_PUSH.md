# Quick Push Instructions

Your code is ready! The repository might exist, but your token needs `repo` permissions.

## Fastest Solution:

1. **Create the repository on GitHub** (if not already created):
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - Name: `riseandshinehrm-2`
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Push using this command** (it will prompt for credentials):
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   
   - Username: `Aaron071982`
   - Password: Your Personal Access Token (the one you gave me)
   
   OR use this one-liner with token embedded:
   ```bash
   git push -u https://Aaron071982:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/Aaron071982/riseandshinehrm-2.git main
   ```

## Alternative: Generate New Token with Repo Permissions

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Name: "HRM Push Token"
3. **Select scope**: ✅ `repo` (full control of private repositories)
4. Click "Generate token"
5. Copy the new token and use it in the push command above

**Your code is already committed and ready to push!** Just need the right permissions. 🚀

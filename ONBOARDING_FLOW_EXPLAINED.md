# Onboarding Flow - How It Works

## ✅ YES - They See Documents Immediately!

When you create an RBT, hire them, and they log in, here's what happens:

## Complete Flow

### Step 1: Create RBT
- You create an RBT profile in Admin Dashboard
- A User account is created automatically
- RBT status: `NEW` or `CANDIDATE`

### Step 2: Hire RBT
When you click **"Hire Candidate"**:
- ✅ User role updated to `RBT`
- ✅ User marked as `isActive: true`
- ✅ **All 6 onboarding tasks are automatically created**
- ✅ Welcome email sent automatically

### Step 3: RBT Logs In
When they log in with their email:
1. ✅ System checks for onboarding tasks
2. ✅ If tasks exist (they will!), shows onboarding dashboard
3. ✅ All 6 tasks are visible immediately:
   - Download HIPAA Basics PDF
   - Review HHS HIPAA Portal
   - Download Confidentiality Agreement Templates
   - Complete HIPAA Training (HHS link)
   - Digital Signature Confirmation
   - Upload Onboarding Package

### Step 4: Complete Onboarding
- RBT completes all 6 tasks
- System automatically redirects to main dashboard
- They can now access schedule, hours, etc.

## What They See When They Log In

**Before completing onboarding:**
- Welcome message
- Progress bar (0% → 100%)
- All 6 onboarding tasks with:
  - Document download links
  - Training link (embedded)
  - Signature pad
  - Package upload

**After completing all tasks:**
- Automatically redirected to main dashboard
- Can access schedule, hours, leave requests, etc.

## Current Status

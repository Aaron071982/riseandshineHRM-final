# Create New Repository - Quick Steps

## Option 1: Create via GitHub Website (Easiest)

2. **Repository name**: `riseandshineHRM-new` (or any name you prefer)
3. **Description**: "Rise and Shine HRM System"
4. **Visibility**: Public or Private (your choice)

7. **Then run this command** (replace `YOUR_NEW_REPO_NAME` with the name you chose):
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Aaron071982/YOUR_NEW_REPO_NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
